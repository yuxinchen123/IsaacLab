# Plot Visualization Issue Analysis

## The Problem
The original plotting scripts were looking for metric names that didn't exist in the actual TensorBoard logs, causing most plots to show "No data available".

## Root Cause: Metric Name Mismatch

### What the scripts were looking for vs. what actually exists:

| Original Script Expected | Actual TensorBoard Metrics | Status |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| `reward/episode` | `Train/mean_reward` | ❌ Wrong name |
| `episode_length/mean` | `Train/mean_episode_length` | ❌ Wrong name |
| `policy_loss` | `Loss/surrogate` | ❌ Wrong name |
| `value_loss` | `Loss/value_function` | ❌ Wrong name |
| `entropy_loss` | `Loss/entropy` | ❌ Wrong name |
| `learning_rate` | `Loss/learning_rate` | ❌ Wrong name |
| `action_noise` | `Policy/mean_noise_std` | ❌ Wrong name |

### Complete list of available metrics in Isaac Lab:
```
"Episode_Reward/action_l2"      - Action smoothness penalty
"Episode_Reward/alive"          - Bonus for staying alive
"Episode_Reward/energy"         - Energy consumption penalty
"Episode_Reward/joint_pos_limits" - Joint limit violations
"Episode_Reward/move_to_target"  - Progress toward target
"Episode_Reward/progress"       - Overall progress reward
"Episode_Reward/upright"        - Bonus for staying upright
"Episode_Termination/time_out"  - Timeout terminations
"Episode_Termination/torso_height" - Height-based terminations
"Loss/entropy"                  - Entropy loss for exploration
"Loss/learning_rate"            - Current learning rate
"Loss/surrogate"                - PPO surrogate loss
"Loss/value_function"           - Value function loss
"Perf/collection time"          - Data collection time
"Perf/learning_time"            - Learning update time
"Perf/total_fps"                - Total training FPS
"Policy/mean_noise_std"         - Action noise standard deviation
"Train/mean_episode_length"     - Average episode length
"Train/mean_episode_length/time" - Episode length over time
"Train/mean_reward"             - Average episode reward
"Train/mean_reward/time"        - Reward over time
```

## The Solution
1. **Identified actual metric names** by reading the TensorBoard events file directly
2. **Updated the plotting script** to use the correct Isaac Lab metric names
3. **Enhanced visualization** with reward component breakdown and better statistics

## Results After Fix
- ✅ All major metrics now display properly
- ✅ Training progression clearly visible
- ✅ Reward improved from -0.456 to 144.596 (+145.053)
- ✅ Episode length improved from ~20 to ~900+ steps (46x improvement)
- ✅ Complete reward component breakdown available
- ✅ Training performance metrics (FPS, losses) properly tracked

## Why This Happened
Isaac Lab uses its own metric naming convention that differs from generic RL frameworks. The original scripts assumed standard metric names commonly used in other RL libraries, but Isaac Lab prefixes metrics with categories like:
- `Train/` for training statistics
- `Loss/` for different loss components  
- `Episode_Reward/` for reward components
- `Policy/` for policy-related metrics
- `Perf/` for performance metrics

This is actually a **good thing** because it provides much more detailed breakdown of what's happening during training!
